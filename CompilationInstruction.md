# How to compile #

SephPlayer was compiled with Adobe Flash Builder 4.6, so it's suggested that you use the same IDE when working on the project. However, it's true that you can use almost any other IDE, provided all library dependencies are properly satisfied.


# Library dependencies #

  * /lib/analytic\_flash.swc
  * /lib/Sepharian.swc
  * /lib/tweener.swc
  * /src/com/

Of course you can always upgrade these libraries to their corresponding newer versions, and I'd be more than happy to hear about compatibility issues (if any) so that I can upgrade SephPlayer to support newer versions of these libraries. Thank you very much for your contributions!
